# FIA: Feminism in Action --- Final Project for Kode with Klossy camp 2022

## Inspiration
Roe vs Wade was officialy overturned last month (June 2022). More than half the states have already put some restrictions on abortion access (as of July 2022). We wanted to create an app to inform people about the importance and impact of abortion (why we beleive it's needed and is should be treated as healthcare).

## Pages + features
* Home page (designed by Chloe)
    * Button to direct you to each of the different pages
* Quiz page (designed by Arianna)
    * Questions on women’s history/women’s rights
    * Click buttons to move from page to page
* History of Abortion Timeline page (designed by Alex)
    * Interactive timeline on abortion laws and statistics in the US over time
    * When button by timeline clicked, text appears about the year and event. All other text is hiddent
* Contraceptives (designed by Chloe)
    * Information on 12 contraception methods.
    * User is able to scroll through the different methods and find out info about each. 

## Future Iterations
* Acknowledge how disproportionately abortions affect different groups
    * People of color and those who identify as LGBTQ+ are often the hardest hit from abortion bans
    * Create page w/ information about the interconnectedness of racism and abortion access
* Fix the constraints!
    * Right now, the app looks the best on the Iphone 11 Max Pro - otherwise the proportions are really off
* Add a page which directs the user on how to help based on their location
    * Shows nearby protests (+ their upcoming dates) and how to donate to places such as planned parenthood
